DATA :

This project will utilize publicly available data from Wikipedia and Foursquare.

Get the data from wiki portal - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M and prepare it.
Get the location coordinates from - https://cocl.us/Geospatial_data

Merge both the data to arrive at our source of data.

Above data sources will be needed to extract/generate the required information:

- Group the neighbourhoods based on postal code and use K-means clustering to analyse and visualize the data.
- Location details like latitude and longitude details are fetched from remote location, alternatively they can also be retrieved from Google Maps API. 

- Fetch the facilities like Restaurants, Bus Stations, Schools, Coffee shops, Grocery Shops etc in every neighborhood using Foursquare API
- Identify the neighbourhood which matches our requirement - having most of preferred facilities, and recommend it to the customer.

Specifically, all Toronto neighborhood details along with their postal codes are available here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M

The focus of this project will be to acquire data by using web scraping method of python and then clean the data,
populate the data then use foursquare API to collect the data of the all the neighborhood places 
then use k-means clustering method to find the best fit.
