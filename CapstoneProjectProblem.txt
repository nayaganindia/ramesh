PROJECT TITLE :  Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods - Locate ideal neighbourhood

BUSINESS PROBLEM : 

In this modern age, Canada is a very popular immigration destination. Lots of people are migrating to various states of Canada and needed lots of information on good housing prices and reputated schools for their children.

This scope of this Project is to help indians migrating to Toronto to identify a best neighborhood as a comparative analysis between neighborhoods.

The features used in analysis will be to identify neghbourhoods where following facilities are mostly available nearby like school, shops, transport facilities, indian restaurants, medical facilities etc

Thus our business problem to solve is, which neighborhood is ideal to move in for an indian immigrant.
